# Health Insurance Expense Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting health insurance expenses based on personal characteristics of the insured individuals. The dataset used for this project is sourced from the [Machine Learning with R datasets](https://github.com/stedy/Machine-Learning-with-R-datasets/blob/master/insurance.csv).

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that accurately estimates the health expenses (in dollars) incurred by individuals. This is a regression problem where the target variable is the insurance expense, and the features include basic personal characteristics such as age, BMI, and smoking status.

### Key Features

- **Clean Dataset**: The dataset is pre-processed and clean, allowing for efficient data exploration and model development.
- **Categorical Data**: The dataset includes categorical features, necessitating appropriate encoding methods.
- **Medium-Sized Dataset**: The dataset contains 1,338 records, making it manageable for model training and evaluation without requiring extensive computational resources.

## Methodology

- **Data Exploration**: Initial data exploration was conducted to understand the distribution of variables and identify any interesting patterns or correlations.
- **Model Selection**: Emphasis was placed on the correct application of model selection methodologies, including hyperparameter tuning. The approach was designed to be rigorous, simulating access to a large computational infrastructure, though only a limited number of configurations were evaluated.
- **Regression Metrics**: The performance of the models was evaluated using appropriate regression metrics. The choice of metrics was carefully considered and motivated, with references to [scikit-learn's regression metrics](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html#regression-metrics).

## Recommendations

When presenting the findings, the focus was on interesting and informative results. The project report is concise, using textual descriptions, tables, and plots to effectively communicate the insights and performance of the predictive models.
