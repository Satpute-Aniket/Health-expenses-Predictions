# Health insurance prediction
## Overview
This project aims to predict health insurance costs based on a variety of factors using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a predictive model that accurately estimates individual insurance premiums, which can help insurance companies tailor their offerings and pricing strategies more effectively.

## Data Exploration

We begin with a comprehensive initial data exploration to uncover key insights that will inform our model construction. The data is analyzed and presented using descriptive statistics, tables, and visualizations, ensuring the insights are both informative and actionable.

## Model selection and Hyperparameter tuning

We explore and compare several machine learning models, systematically evaluating their performance. Special attention is given to hyperparameter tuning to optimize model accuracy. Multiple configurations are tested, leveraging computational resources effectively. The primary metric used for model evaluation is Mean Squared Error (MSE), with additional residual plots to assess model reliability.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying trends and correlations in the data through visualizations and statistical summaries.
3. **Model Development**: Building various machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tuning model parameters to improve performance using techniques like Grid Search and Cross-Validation.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model accuracy with MSE and visualizing residuals to evaluate prediction errors.

## Results

The final model demonstrated strong predictive capabilities, accurately estimating health insurance costs with a low MSE. Residual plots confirmed the model's reliability, showing a good fit with minimal prediction errors.

## Tools and technologies

- **Python**: For data processing, model development, and evaluation.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive analysis and visualization.
- **Pandas, NumPy**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**: For data visualization.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a systematic approach to predicting health insurance costs using machine learning. The results can help insurance providers optimize their pricing strategies based on individual risk factors.
