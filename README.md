# Health-expenses-Predictions
This project starts with a detailed data exploration to identify key insights that guide model development. Various model selection methods are systematically evaluated, focusing on hyperparameter tuning. The model's performance is measured using Mean Squared Error (MSE), with residual plots for accuracy and reliability.
